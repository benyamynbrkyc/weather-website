# Weather Website
Quick and Lightweight Weather web app for fetching daily weather data for a specified location in search

- app front end made with npm: handlebars (partials and views)
  - dynamic data

- weather fetching done using the mapbox API (geographical coordinates) and the Dark Sky API (weather information for coordinates)
  - Bosnian weather info is a bit buggy in it's grammar :)
